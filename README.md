## Project Overview

MathGeeks is a curriculum-aligned Grade 10 Mathematics tutoring website designed specifically for South African learners.

The platform addresses challenges in mathematics education, such as:
- Poor pass rates
- Limited teacher support
- Curriculum misalignment with global platforms

Unlike generic learning platforms, MathGeeks aligns directly with CAPS (Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement), ensuring localized, relevant, and structured learning support.

This project was developed as a collaborative academic web development project and deployed using Netlify.
